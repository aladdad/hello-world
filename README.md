My name is Abdulaziz Nawar Aladdad.  
i am from Saudi Arabia  
currently i'm an economics major  
however i am also minoring in cit   
and i find it really insightful  
each lab i find new things and  
learn so much  
  
I find these projects  
super insightful  
  
The git tasks are tough but they are not  
ungodly hard to complete  
they are kind of fun   
overall i enjoy them and they are  
rewarding

going well so far  
  
Merging is cool
